# Single Number II

Given a **non-empty** array of integers, every element appears *three* times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one.

**Note:**

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

### Examples
#### Example 1:

>**Input:** [2,2,3,2]<br>
**Output:** 3

#### Example 2:
>**Input:** [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]<br>
**Output:** 99
